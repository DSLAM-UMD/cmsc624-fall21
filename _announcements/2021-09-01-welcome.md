We are excited to welcome you to the Fall 2021 offering of CMSC624 class!

A few organizational moments:
- **Lectures.**
  This year, we offer an in-class of the course. The lectures will not be live-streamed and recorded.
  You can find the links to all materials, including slides, on [ELMS](https://elms.umd.edu/) page.
- **Logistics.**
  Please make sure to familiarize yourself with the [class logistics](/cmsc624-fall21/logistics/).
- **Homework assignments and projects.**
  Release and due dates for homework assignments and project milestones are reflected in the website (announcements will be posted on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kszd5aw0vs2nj){:target="\_blank"}).
  All the relevant information will also appear on the [a1](/cmsc624-fall21/a1/), [a2](/cmsc624-fall21/a2/) and [project](/cmsc624-fall21/project/) pages.

We are looking forward to a productive semester working with you!
